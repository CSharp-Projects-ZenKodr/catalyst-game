## About
This is a currently unnamed story-based platformer-RPG made in Unity as a personal senior project at Oklahoma Christian University.

The challenge with this project is to not only do the programming and development work, but also to create all the art and music assets as well.  It's a very ambitious creative endeavor that will take significant time and effort to fully complete.

This readme will be updated as development continues and features are added.  At the moment the project is still in its beginning phase.
